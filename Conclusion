Conclusion

Tire manufacturing is a complex industrial process which has come a long way from simple rubber tubes filled with air. 
From design to distribution, the tire is a product of state of the art engineering, encompassing materials science, 
manufacturing engineering, and more. The process brings together many types of materials such as natural and synthetic 
rubber, carbon and silica, and metallic and textile components. The structure of the tire is multilayered, with layers of
rubber, cord, and metal interwoven.
